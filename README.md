# Task_Manager.py
This is a python project which uses basic principles to create a handy taskmanager.

Project Synopsis: Simple Task Manager

Title: Simple Task Manager

Overview: The Simple Task Manager is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This project offers a straightforward interface for creating, viewing, completing, and deleting tasks. It operates through a console-based user interface, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

Key Features:
1. Add Task: Users input a task title and description to store new tasks in a list.
2. View Tasks: Displays all existing tasks with an indicator showing whether each task is completed (✓) or not (✗).
3. Complete Task: Allows users to mark a selected task as completed, updating its status.
4. Delete Task: Users can remove tasks by specifying the task number from the list.
5. Exit Option: Provides an option to gracefully exit the program.

User Interaction : The program runs in a loop that prompts the user to select actions from a menu. It handles input errors gracefully by informing users when invalid entries are made.

Flow:
- The main function presents a menu and directs users to the relevant function based on their selection.
- Task management functions (add task, view tasks, complete task, delete task) are well-structured, maintaining simplicity and ease of understanding.

Audience: This project is for beginners learning Python to understand practical implementations of list operations, functions, and basic control structures. It is also  for individuals looking for a simple tool to manage tasks through a command-line interface.


future plans : to add ui using streamlit and make it more accessible
